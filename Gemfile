#The root problem here is that ruby itself comes with bcrypt version 3.1.5 which is having bugs with the newer updates. 
#However when you install or uninstall the bcrypt you are leving behind bcrypt-ruby which it always asks for first and hence all what you are doing won't go through so what to do ? 
#1- uninstall bcrypt and bcrypt-ruby by running these two commands: gem uninstall bcrypt and  gem uninstall bcrypt-ruby
#2- Install it again with gem install bcrypt --platform=ruby 
#3- In your Gemfile write  gem 'bcrypt','~>3.1.11'

gem 'bcrypt','~>3.1.11'
